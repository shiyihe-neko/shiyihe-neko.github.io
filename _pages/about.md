I am a first-year PhD student at [Kahlert School of Computing, University of Utah](https://www.cs.utah.edu/), advised by [Prof.Anna Fariha](https://afariha.github.io/).

I am broadly interested in various data management and human-computer interaction problems, particularly in designing mechanisms for enhancing the usability, explainability, and trustworthiness of data systems.

Feel free to contact me via email: shiyi.he@utah.edu.
